- 👋 Hi, I’m @LizzieNya
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code! New, but don't let that fool you, I'm as sharp as ever!
  - 🌱 I’m currently learning the very basics and exploring the variety of coding languages.
    - In other words, I am what you might consider a 'noob'.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything, any experience helps!

- 😄 Pronouns: she/her 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have no idea what I'm doing ngl.
<!---
QUESTION: how does one use different languages without having to relearn everything?
Also curious about Github Pages.

  もうつまらない私なんかほっといてよ
