- 👋 Hi, I’m @LizzieNya
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code! New, but don't let that fool you, I'm as sharp as ever!
  - 🌱 I’m currently learning the very basics and exploring the variety of coding languages.
    - In other words, I am what you might consider a 'noob'.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything, any experience helps!

Very tight crunched schedule, so if i don't get back to you, please do not take it personally. Feel free to send another email, or just spam my dms if you have me added on any of my personal socials.

 *ねえどうしてこんな感じになったの
  もうつまらない私なんかほっといてよ
  雨のせいにしてしまえちゃいそうな
  汚いこんな世界が大嫌いだ*
